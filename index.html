            <h2>Career</h2>
    <p1>The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was constructed in 1957, commisioned by Northwestern mutual life insurance as a business venture, the ship is named after 
        the insurance companies President. She was launched in June of 1958 in River Rouge, Michigan. The ship was bult to transport taconite pellets across the Great Lakes.
         The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was the largest ship on the Great Lakes for 13 years, and was built to just narrowly fit through the locks,
          famously spectators could reach out and touch the ship as she passed through the locks, so close to the walls it was. She was 729 feet long and weighed 13, 632 tons, making her Queen of the Lakes 
          (an unofficial title given to the longest ship sailing on the Great Lakes). The ships launch was marred by tragedy and bad omens.
           It took 3 attempts to break the bottle on the ships hull to christen the ship, which was considdered by many to be a bads omen.
            Furthermore, upon her launching, a massive wave from her wake collapsed a nearby grandstand, which caused a spectator to suffer a fatal heart attack.
             The SS Edmund Fitzgerald would operate on the Great Lakes for 17 years before her tragic end, when most ships retire after 40 to 50 years.</p1>
