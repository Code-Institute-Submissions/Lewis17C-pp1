            <h2>Construction</h2>
    <section>The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was constructed in 1957, commisioned by Northwestern mutual life insurance as a business venture, the ship is named after the insurance companies President. She was launched in June of 1958 in River Rouge, Michigan. The ship was bult to transport taconite pellets across the Great Lakes. The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was the largest ship on the Great Lakes for 13 years, and was built to just narrowly fit through the locks, famously spectators could reach out and touch the ship as she passed through the locks, so close the walls it was.
